        "This is better and clearly a great score the most stocks gold price is between 50 to 1000 so a typical prediction error of 53 is satisfying. Now we will calculate Capital Asset Pricing Model. The CAPM uses the principles of Modern Portfolio Theory to determine if a security is fairly valued. It relies on assumptions about investor behaviors, risk and return distributions, and market fundamentals that don’t match reality. However, the underlying concepts of CAPM and the associated efficient frontier can help investors understand the relationship between expected risk and reward as they make better decisions about adding securities to a portfolio. Now we will use some statiscal function from scipy which will help us to calculate Beta which is component of capm so what is Beta?Beta is a component of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which calculates the cost of equity funding and can help determine the rate of return to expect relative to perceived risk.A beta greater than 1.0 suggests that the stock is more volatile than the broader market, and a beta less than 1.0 indicates a stock with lower volatility. Our Monthly Beta value is less than 1.0 our value is 0.57 which indicates stock has lower volatility"
